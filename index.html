<h2>
	Introduction:
</h2>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quiccPrints gives smartphone users the ability to a photo of a thumb and convert
it into a fingerprint image.  We were initially motivated to pursue this project
because of its useful applications to law enforcement.  Many fingerprinting
devices are large and clunky, some even require an outlet.  In-field police
officers, however, often face life-or-death situations where it is out of the
question to be held back by such a device, reguardless of its usefulness.  If
officers could quickly and easily scan fingerprints and check them in a database,
they would be able to check for people's past criminal history without the need
for non-biometric forms of identification.  For simplicity, we designed quiccPrints
to only focus on capturing thumbprints, but we believe that our software could
be easily expanded upon to include other fingers.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there have been new, more portable fingerprinting devices created to
satisfy this need, we thought it would be cool to give officers the same ability,
to fingerprint and check for criminals in a database, with only their cellphone.
We were especially drawn to creating this functionality with just a smartphone
because, in the modern day, officers are likely already carrying a smartphone.
Thus, adding this extra functionality to the smartphone gives them one less thing
to carry even if there are already more portable fingerprinting devices.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing that was consistantly in the back of our minds throughout the project
was that these fingerprints not only had to be extracted from photos, but extracted
well enough from these photos so that they sould later be checked in a database.
It is important to note that such an assessment of fingerprint quality is often
done by organizations like NIST (the National Institute of Standards and
Technology), so, due to time constraints and recources, we were unable to
assess the prints' quality.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the large volume of work involved in the project,
each member of our team was assigned a certain group of subtasks that would
countribute to our overall goal of extracting fingerprints.  Because we were unable
to create a data base for our prints and to check for existing prints in the database
due to time constraints, we decided to, instead, output several statistics of interest
for each of our output fingerprints.  Thus, the divided subtasks were as follows:
create a smartphone application to take the photos to be processed; devise an
algorithm that can take in photos and output fingerprint images; devise an
algorithm to determine several key statistics of each fingerprint.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My task was to implement feature extraction. In order words, finding a way to describe the contents of the thumbprints that Elijah gave to me. Therefore, I read through different scholarly articles that discussed the best ways to implement feature extraction. I primarily consulted this source for my research: <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/49ad/2473ecc1dcbfdfc9a981f5191a1224107ef1.pdf"> [4]</a>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For figures, <a href="terrance_figures.pdf"> click here <a/>.  As I mentioned earlier, to complete this task, I first decided to conduct some research of my own to find the best approach to take for feature extraction. I read through different scholarly articles that discussed the best ways to implement feature extraction. Once I found a couple of different approaches, I began testing and implementing the different approaches using jupyter notebook. I quickly realized that the Crossing Number Concept was the best algorithm to use. One reason I liked this algorithm is because the function was pretty straightforward to implement. It uses a 3x3 sliding window to scan the local neighborhood (Figure 3). It performs this operation on the outside pixels and returns the value (Figure 4). I can use this chart (Figure 5) to determine what type of point (Figure 6) the center pixel represents. For my actual feature extraction function, I decided to explicitly have variables to represent each position in the 3x3 sliding window because it made the function a lot easier to understand. It also made the operation performed on the outside neighbors clearer and easier to understand because originally, I ran into a lot of problems trying to condense the size of the overall feature extraction method. I successfully implemented this Crossing Number Concept algorithm so that we can now use this algorithm to output a new grayscale image, where the brighter pixels have higher CN values and darker pixels have lower CN values. As a result, we now know the locations of the different types of points. The algorithm I implemented also outputs the total counts of each type of point that are in the given image. I also added a portion to this algorithm that outputs a color image instead of grayscale image where each different type of point represents a different color, so we can better see the results from the algorithm. Since we modified the app so that we only have the top portion/actual thumbprint (Figure 2), I decided that we did not need to add a post-processing element to the algorithm. I stand firm with this decision because now we are only performing operations on the actual thumbprint, instead of the other entire thumb with the extra noisy features (Figure 1). So now our results do not get interfered and we consistently get the same final total counts of each type of point. The only libraries for this process that are used are skimage and matplotlib.

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I originally started trying to extract a thumbprint for an image, I realized
  that I was faced with not only the task of extracting the thumbprint, but also cropping
  the image to the thumbprint.  The latter proved to be far more challenging.  Before I could do anything,
  I needed to compile a database of people's fingerprints.  To do so, I went to several of my
  friends and asked for their consent to take photos of their thumbs, which would be anonymized, to
  improve a fingerprint detection algorithm.  I made sure to not only collect fingerprints of students
  with a single shade of skin.  I collected thumb photos from frineds of all races, so that performance
  would not be biased to a certain race.  All photos were collected with the flash on at roughly the
  same distance because this lead to the best performance.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I collected the photos, to extract the fingerprint, all I needed to do was use
  local thresholding, with hyperparameters tuned based its performance on several thumbprint photos.
  Local thresholding works by thresholding an image based on luminosity values withing a certain
  window instead of based on the entire image.  This was helpful for extracting fingerprints because
  the peaks of the fingers tend to be brighter than the valleys.  This way, if we set all the values
  of the bright peaks to zero and all the values of the valley to one, we can get a fingerprint.  The
  only thing that needed to be done after this point was to use a median filter to get rid of any noise
  residuals in the photo (to clean up the image), and to use a mask to crop out everything in the photo
  except for the fingerprint (described below).
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to make the mask, I first converted the image to grayscale, and used the mask
  overlayed on the app's preview sceen to crop the image.  Afterwards, I used histogram
  equalization to stretch out the luminosity.  I noticed that this emphasized the outline of the thumb, which
  made detecting the thumb reigon much easier.  Afterwards, I used a heavy median filter to denoise the image while
  still maintaining the edges.  Afterwards, we use another local thresholding on this new smoothed image because
  I noticed that it helps seperate regions in the image.  I did notice, however, that changinging the hyperparameters
  slighty changed the regions that would later be captured with a region detector, as provided by skimage.measure.
  Thus, I spereated a series of locally thresholded images into several region seperated images.  I stored these
  labeled images in memory then came back to them later.  In the meantime, I needed to figure out a way to automactically
  choose the thumbprint region of these labeled images to make a mask with.  In order to choose the region, I used six high
  frequency sign wave windows and convolved them with the original cropped image.  I could have used a Gabor filter,
  but I realized that having the sine wave contained to only a portion of the window to convolve with made it so that
  frequencies were less emphasized when we did the convolutions.  That is, the output image was a much more uniform gray.
  With these high frequency sign waves, however, the output convolved images all have bright patches around where the fingerprint
  was, where there was very high frequency.  Thus, we made a separate image by taking the OR of all of these convolved images
  which we then overlayed with each of our region images that was stored in memory.  This way, we could then choose the region that
  contained the most bright pixels in the high frequency overlay image.  That is, we choose the region that has the highest spacial
  frequency, which should be the thumbprint, especially becuase everyhting that is not in the foreground gets a little blurred out.
  Therefore, we are able to sucessfully choose the region that countains a thumb, reguardless of a similarly colored background.  After
  we have chosen each of these masks, we then overlayed them with one another to make a new mask using the OR operation, and then
  we used the binary closing operation to fill in any holes.  Finally, we use an erosion filter to tighten the mask to the thumb outline and
  we take to difference of the mask and our output fingerprint to crop it accordingly.

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that our project revolves around the use of mobile cameras, I decided that I would be using my personal Android device to develop the user interface and backend for the mobile app. I started the development process by designing the various classes that were necessary to work with the Android's hardware. This was necessary because the android SDK is written in Java (so an object oriented design is necessary). Since the device I was working on was an HTC One that was running  <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-install-android-4-0-ice-cream-sandwich-on-htc-desire-s-46402/">Ice Cream Sandwich</a>, I had to work with a deprecated camera API. After designing the classes and the way that they would interact with each other I began implementing the live camera preview (as would be standard on any mobile device) and the view holder that would display the camera. </p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to consider that there was not a great deal of space on my Android's hardware so I refrained from storing captured images. Given this consideration, I had to introduce external storage via a database. So, I used the built in support for Firebase to hold onto images that would have otherwise been in the camera's memory. </p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last piece of the applicaiton lied in the method of sending the image. However, this is also where many issues arose in the Android version of the application. It turned out that the devices was attempting to compress the image, even though it was not being stored in memory. The likely cause was that trying to send the image to the database was resulting in compression of the image, but when this happened the quality of the image became horrible. To combat this I did implement custom settings for when to atuofocus but there was not much help there. </p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The previous issues lead to the use of an iOS application. This was mostly because the hardware behind the iPhone camera API is much more powerful. I was not familiar with the iOS development workflow but when researching the practices that iOS developers use when buidling applications, I found that it was nearly identical to the methodologies used in Android development. The biggest hurdle in taking on an iOS version of the application became the need to either learn Objective-C of Swift. I found that Swift was far simpler to understand and was similar to JavaScript so I decided to rebuild the application using Swift and the XCode IDE. At this point the challenge became figuring out the various analogs of the custom camera components in the Android application for the iOS application. Fortunately the documentation and other developer's questions on Stack Overflow helped me figure out how to meet our teams needs. </p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The iOS application makes use of the, very flexible, AVFoundation framework. There are other frameworks that are available for using the camera on an iOS device, but this one gave me the most control while not requiring me to write ridiculous amounts of code for the functionality. I decided that the actual interface should be simple enough for anyone to be able to pick up the device and utilize the application. To make the processing of a caputred image easier I added an overlay to the live preview for the application. The overlay is an outline of a generic thumb that is in bright green. There are two majors parts ot the interface: the first is the live preview and the second is the captured image preview. The live preview consits of a button to actually capture the image. The image preview consists of an buttons that allow for sending the image to a server or returning to the previous view. </p>

The image preview consists of an buttons that allow for sending the image to a server or returning to the previous view. Lastly, we decided to run a Node.js server that would recieve the images from the phone and process them with Python code. This was done to make our lives a little easier but also because of the simplicity that goes behind creating an express application. To get the python code to run in Node, we had to create a process for the algorithm to run in.</p>


<p> The workflow is shown best in the following diagram: </p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say that in the end, the algorithm tends to perform
well.  One thing that I was really happy with is the fact that the algorithm
tends to be able to correctly extract the thumbprint and create a nice mask so that
we only output the thumbprint regardless of similar backgrounds around the thumb.
You can see an example of what I mean at the top of the page.  Regardless of the
similar background surrounding the thumb, we are able to extract only the thumb's print.
This is thanks to the fact that we are taking into account spatial frequency, not just luminosity
values when we are trying to find the thumb.  As said earlier, we use sine waves and convulutions
to detect regions of high spatial frequency (like a fingerprint), and use that to distingush where
the thumb is.  Unfortunately, most often the algorithm will also take a print of parts of the thumb that
not concidered a thumbprint.  For example, the algorithm will often notice the high freqencies of the
base of the thumb and turn that into a finger print as well as, or sometimes instead of the thumbprint.
For an example of this, see Terrance's <a href="terrance_figures.pdf"> Figure 1. <a/>

<h4>
  Actual Schedule:
</h4>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Task wise, I followed the original schedule closely; timeline wise, I did not.
I am very fortunate that we gave ourselves a several week pad at the end of the project
timeline to close any loose ends.  I lost a good deal of time trying to translate
all my work into Objective-C++ so that we could integrate my opencv code into the
iphone app, but we never actually ended up integrating all the code because we realize
it cost too much time.  Although it would have been nice to have all the image
processing done locally, having all the code run on an external server proved
easiest task.  It was especially helpful because throughout the process, I ended
up changing my algorithm a lot.  C++, however, is not the best language for prototyping,
so I would prototype in Python, then translate to C++.  Additionally, with C++
I could not use the skimage library, which I ended up using extensively.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asside from this issue, I also ended up spending a lot of time just developing
my algorithm.  I spent countless hours just playing around with all the tools
that we learned in class, like blurring, histogram equalization, edge detection,
masking, etc.  Although I originally planned on finishing the algorithm in the first
two weeks, it ended up taking the entire ~6 weeks to complete.  Part of the
reason it took so long was because as we progressed through the course, I kept
learning new tooks that I wanted to integrate with the algorithm to make it
more robust.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A last thing to note is that I never actually helped out
Terrance with his feature extraction task because I became too bogged down with my
own tasks.  Overall, this reflects the our work flow throughout the whole
development process: we made ambitious goals at the start, did not complete
everything we originally wanted too, but kept reassessing goals along the way and
in the end we ended up creating software that I am proud of.

  Issues:
</h2>

<h3>
  Terrance:
</h3>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Originally, when we first divided up the work amongst the three of us. I was originally tasked with coming up with object detection. After a few days and feelings of frustration, we decided that we did not need object detection, since the app was going to take a square image centered around the thumb in the middle. This did not affect my schedule too much since this happened very early on in the semester. Additionally, when I was first trying to implement feature extraction, I ran into a problem when it was trying to thin the image. Initially I did not know how to thin a thumbprint, so I did some research to learn how to actually thin an image. I eventually noticed that under skimage morphology there is a thin operation that outputs the desired skeleton image and I began using that operation to output the thinned thumbprint images. Luckily, it only took me a few days to find this solution. Unfortunately, I later ran into another problem when I was trying make my feature extraction algorithm run faster because at the time I had made separate functions for extracting features, printing the statistics and showing the cool color images. I was able to fix this by having one function that has completes all these tasks more efficiently. This function has parameters so that the user can put either true or false if they want certain options such as printing the statistics or showing the color images that represents the different types of points.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As said before, we ran into several issues trying to convert
the python code into Objective-C++ to be integrated into the application.  In the end,
as said before, we ended up abandoning ship and just sending all the code to be processes
on an external server with Python so that I did not hav to keep translating my code between languages.
Also, implementation wise, I would say that I experienced my most significant issues trying to automatically crop the images
taken by the phone to just include the thumb.  This would have likely been much easier to do with a CNN, but given that
we did not have a massive dataset of thumbs with boxes around them, I resorted to image processing techniques.  In the end,
my efforts proved unsecessful.  To get around the cropping issue, we added a box on the camera preview for people to stick their
thumbs into before the photo was taken.  This way we could just crop around the box and not have to worry about the thumb's lostaion
in the image.  Also, as said earlier, we still have the issue where we sometimes do not correctly identify
a thumb region and instead will think that the base of a thumb should be included in the thumbprint because of its
high frequency.  This, however, I think is expected, that the algorithm is imperfect, because it is extremely
difficult to generallize such an algorithm without extensive training data or the help of more modern
methods of machine learning.  Lastly, I would also say that the last issue that I want to highlight is the issue of time.
Our project was incredibly ambitious so the entire time we definitely felt a strong time crunch.

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest issue that I ran into occurred in the first few stages of testing the Android Application. When the app was fully built I attempted to collect images of various objects around me and I found that the quality of the image being sent to the preview layer of the application was horrible. There were a few adjustments that I made to the autofocusing but android really tries to compress images. Interestingly enough the methods used by the Android architecture to compress data is how they are able to keep the phones relatively inexpensive. Regardless this was an issue for our project and there was too much information being lost when attempting to capture an image. Not to mention that the image required fine details in order to have the IP algorithm to process is correctly. </p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another initial set back was the lack of storage on the Android device. Storing an image is expensive when considering the limited resources on the phone. And I decided to use external storage instead (i.e. a database). The challenge with this was finding a way to send the bytes to the database in a way that did not result in lossy compression. However, as with the previous issue, the device will automatically do this when trying to pass data around. </p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next issue that came up occurred during the iOS development. While the quality of the images being produced were great there was still a need to send them to be processed by the Algorithm that was written in Python. The actual issue here is that there would be a decent amount of latency when getting a response from the Algorithm because the computations were happenning on a difference maching. We did experiment with having all of the openCV code on the app but this task was not tractable. </p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final issue arose when trying to process the images from the Node.js server. There was a ton of work that went into resolving dependencies and setting up the environment so that the IP libraries were actually being loaded into the python script. </p>


<h2>
  Future Work:
</h2>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although you likely could collect fingerprints from fingers other than thumbs
with the current software, the software has been optimized to work only with
thumbprints.  If we were given more time, we would like to add this additional
functionality.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, as briefly mentioned earlier, we currently have no evaluation metric of
fingerprint quality, and would likely have to consult an outside agency like
NIST to do so.  This would be another importent future step to take because,
although we can often successfully collect thumbprints with the software, we
currently have no understanding of whether the prints would be considered good
or not.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connected to asessing fingerprint quality, we would ultamately like to give
users the ability to not only take fingerprints from their cellphones, but also
then send the prints to a database to be checked for a match.  This was originally
a key part of our application, but due to the difficulty involved with developing
an iphone app without previous experience and developing a unique fingerprint
extraction algorithm, we faced significant setbacks.
</p>

<p>Lastly, given more time we would love to figure out how to get the iOS application to do all of the work that we have spread across the phone and the serever. Ideally this would be an application that would do all of the image processing instantly (or as quickly as possible).</p>
